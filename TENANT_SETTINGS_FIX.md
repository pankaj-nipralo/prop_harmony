# Tenant Settings Component Fix Summary

## âœ… **Issues Identified and Fixed**

### **1. Import Path Issues**
**Problem**: The main TenantSettings.jsx file was importing components from a non-existent `./tenant-settings/` subdirectory.

**Fix**: Updated import paths to point to the correct location:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken)
import SettingsNav from "./tenant-settings/SettingsNav";
import ProfileSettings from "./tenant-settings/ProfileSettings";
import PasswordChangeModal from "./tenant-settings/PasswordChangeModal";
import PropertyPreferences from "./tenant-settings/PropertyPreferences";
import PaymentMethods from "./tenant-settings/PaymentMethods";

// AFTER (Fixed)
import SettingsNav from "./SettingsNav";
import ProfileSettings from "./ProfileSettings";
import PasswordChangeModal from "./PasswordChangeModal";
import PropertyPreferences from "./PropertyPreferences";
import PaymentMethods from "./PaymentMethods";
```

### **2. Missing React Import**
**Problem**: PasswordChangeModal.jsx was missing the React import.

**Fix**: Added React import:
```javascript
// BEFORE
import { Dialog, DialogContent } from "@/components/ui/dialog";

// AFTER
import React from "react";
import { Dialog, DialogContent } from "@/components/ui/dialog";
```

### **3. Incorrect Icon Import**
**Problem**: DirhamSvg was being imported from lucide-react instead of the assets folder.

**Fix**: Updated import in PaymentMethods.jsx:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken)
import { Building, CreditCard, Plus, Trash2, DirhamSvg } from "lucide-react";

// AFTER (Fixed)
import { Building, CreditCard, Plus, Trash2 } from "lucide-react";
import DirhamSvg from "@/assets/Dirham";
```

### **4. Missing Notifications Section**
**Problem**: The navigation included a "notifications" section, but there was no corresponding render section in the component.

**Fix**: Added a complete notifications section with toggles for:
- Maintenance Notifications
- Inspection Reminders  
- Lease Renewal Alerts
- Community Updates
- Preferred Contact Method selection
